# myshadow



Myshadow is a mobile application with which makeup enthusiasts can easily find and share user-uploaded swatches on a diverse range of skin tones, helping them make more informed eyeshadow purchases wherever they are.
I worked with several classmates during a Mobile Apps and Services course (CS4261 | Spring 2019) to design and develop this application. Myshadow won 1st Place in the Climate Solutions category at Georgia Tech's Convergence Innovation Competition (CIC).
You can learn more about the motivation behind the project, my teammates, and CIC by visiting the links below.
